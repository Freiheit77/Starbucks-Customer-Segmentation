# Starbucks Customer Segmentation and Promotion Analysis
Starbucks sends out an offer to users of the mobile app. An offer can be merely an advertisement for a drink or an actual offer such as a discount or BOGO (buy one get one free). However, not all discount offers could be converted. This project aims to explore and understand customer characteristics and give suggestions about future promotions accordingly.
